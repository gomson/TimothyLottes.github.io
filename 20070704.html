<h1>20070704 - Network Latency</h1>
<br>

Here is some interesting network latency info.
<br>
<br><ol><li>(6.8fps) 147ms ping time from California to London (round trip).</li> 
<li>(16fps) 60ms ping time from Chicago to Utah (round trip).</li> 
<li>(4fps) 250ms maximum ping time to most anywhere on internet.</li> 
<li>Maximum tollerance for FPS is 200ms ping (5fps).</li> 
<li>Ideal is 50ms ping (20 fps).</li></ol>
<br>
A P2P (peer to peer) game will have 1/2 the latency of the standard server model. No need to send to server and back, players just send directly to other players. 
<strong>So a P2P network connection from New York to California, should be able to have under a 50ms one way trip (20fps)!</strong>
