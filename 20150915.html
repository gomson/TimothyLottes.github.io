<h1>20150915 - Bacon Wrapped Sour Cream</h1>
<br>
<center><img src="20150915.png"></center><br>
Typical breakfast for a fatatarian.
Sour cream from grass fed cows + sharp cheddar cheese + garlic chopped.
All wrapped in bacon which was fried in itself but not converted to charcoal like many Americans seem to prefer.
