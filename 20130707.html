<h1>20130707 - Slab Hash</h1>
<br>

<i>Something I decided not to use but wanted to write down for possible future reference. This idea isn't new either...</i> Start with a slab size. Slab being some prime multiple of the size of a cacheline. Prime to increase cacheline set aliasing when cachelines of slabs are not always fully used. Take a large chunk of memory which has N slabs. Treat this memory as a hash table with something like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/wiki/MurmurHash3">MurmurHash3</a> as a hash function. Instead of traditional {key, pointerToData} which usually implies usually 2 cache misses even with no key collisions, store {key, data} in the slab (avoids a second cache miss).
