<h1>20150912 - Self-Correcting Part 2 or Rather a Rant on Why Extreme DoD</h1>

<i>Related idea to the prior post, and as a partial reply to some twitter comments...</i><br>
<br>
A "modern" API effectively coupled to a language: 
everything revolves around calling "functions",
which is a lock-in to a very specific and constrained way of thinking.<br>
<br>
What if the API instead is a language agnostic description of data layout, 
with some protocols (again data layout) for communication (message passing).
The "language" need not matter, and is completely replaceable at will.
The components which transform the data, aka the nodes in the program's data flow,
could be written in any language and are effectively throw-away, replaceable pieces. 
<br>
<br>
The aim is to get to the point where the program is a canvas which is easily and instantly malleable,
but still runs at to-the-metal performance, with zero downside to dangerous experimentation --- that instant feedback addiction loop.
<br>
<br>
GPU provides this natively: dedicated hardware to contain accesses to within resources.
Traditionally the data layout is the collection of images and buffers,
the format of the data inside those resources,
and the rules at which the data can be adjusted.
For GPU programming using the "bind-all" style of programming
(where there is only one giant descriptor set with everything in it,
so that all shaders have access to all descriptors):
shaders accessing wrong resources is less of a problem,
the larger problem is out of bounds access in a given resource.
<br>
<br>
On the GPU you can build a pipeline of operations which keeps running even in the presence of bad data.
Sure the output may be totally wrong, but it runs.
For live compressed video broadcast in the presence of packet loss, 
you have sweeping I (non-predictive encoded) macro-block(s) which
acts as a cleaner which causes the frame to re-converge to correct form
when data goes bad.
This same concept can be applied to GPU data.
Resource caches could have a cleaner which periodically
at a slow rate reloads parts of the data from storage.
Or with hardware support for async compute,
run a very low utilization and low priority background job which rebuilds procedural structures,
or validates correctness of various data structures.
The robustness of such a system might enable things like partial state saves
and then restores from out of sync systems, 
to work enough to be useful.
This also has a relation to maintaining bounded frame rate,
designing in ability for the engine to limit itself and scale regardless of input,
and perhaps adapt to rapidly varying limits.
This isn't really a programming convention for language,
it is more about making robust solutions which allow for rapid development.
<br>
<br>
One of the key components missing from PC GPU APIs is a stable way to mutate 
the GPU command stream from the GPU, 
or perhaps this just starts with efficient predication in a given stream:
just place everything possible in the baked stream which gets replayed all the time,
then use logic embedded in the stream to avoid things which need not run (but with a decision based on active GPU state),
and dispatch indirect for variable workloads.
This works as long as the kernels/shaders in the graph are constant.
When code is specialized instead of data, then the process breaks down.
However, specializing code is ultimately what leads to giant bloatware and development grid-lock.
Simplification favors data specialization over code specialization.
Second issue, when bindings are specialized instead of data,
then the process breaks down.
This is why I'm a "bind-all" type of person.
If I'm stuck with limited bindings I'd rather take the hit using texture arrays.
<br>
<br>
This is also heavily related to memory organization.
I don't dynamically allocate in the traditional sense.
I always statically partition into fixed resources with bound limits at start time,
with aliasing to maximize utilization.
Machines have GB's of memory, why variable size dynamically allocate anything.
Use a dead simple fixed size resource pool allocator,
which is trivial to implement on highly parallel machines like GPUs.
<br>
<br>
Getting back to CPUs, having function call interfaces for everything is a disease.
What I much rather have is a collection of ports or interfaces in a fixed layout in memory.
Starting with something simple like time.
If the hardware has an accessible wall-clock time interface, say via some ISA opcode,
then I don't need a function to get the time.
I just need a convention for this fixed layout in memory of where to find the base time value
which I add to the ISA opcode results to get the real time.
Now for keyboard access.
Just give me a key bitarray at a fixed location in the memory layout.
Have a background thread atomically OR bits on key presses,
while I atomically AND out bits after I process key presses.
How about file access.
Just have a convention for maximum number of file handles,
maximum path size, a bit array to flag entries which are new requested transactions, 
a bit array for the OS to reply that a transaction is finished, 
a convention that lowered array elements (requests) are completed first, etc,
setup fixed arrays for this stuff in memory.
Everything ends up being, write data to memory, then ring some kind of doorbell,
to signal to the OS to get busy.
There is no functional interface,
just a text document which describes the memory layout and how to use it.
<br>
<br>
Bringing this back to GPUs, when the GPU can just write into CPU-side memory,
and there is some convention for triggering an interrupt,
or some OS convention to poll at a rate in which interrupts are not necessary
(aka you don't run hot then sleep, but rather stay live at lowest power state,
with cores powered down), then the GPU and CPU simply access the same
memory as the CPU to communicate with the OS.
And perhaps you split the read and write sections of this memory,
and not depend on atomics as in my prior examples, etc.
New OS functionality doesn't need a new API when the GPU wants to access,
the API = dead simple loads and stores.
