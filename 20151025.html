<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/backyard-bbq-pit-durham">Backyard BBQ Pit in Durham</a> - Probably the best pulled pork I have ever had. Fatatarian friendly, can ask for extra fat, and classic Eastern North Carolina vinegar based sauce.<br>
<li><a href="http://www.second-empire.com/">Second Empire</a> - Best restaurant in Raleigh. Year round specials of Filet Mignon and Foie Gras plates constantly changing. Classic 1879 building in the heart of Raleigh.<br>
<li><a href="http://www.rushhourkarting.com/">Rush Hour Karting</a> - Race all night Thursdays for $42. 5 hours interleaved with other customers, but often nearly non-stop.<br>
<li><a href="http://www.ficklecreekfarm.com/">Fickle Creek Farm</a> - My primary local source for eggs, pork, lamb, duck, chicken, beef. Found at the <a href="http://wwfm.ag/">Western Wake Farmers Market</a> and others around the area.<br>
<li><a href="http://localsseafood.com/">Locals Seafood</a> - Rainbow Trout, Scallops, etc. Also at Western Wake Farmers Market.<br>
<li><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/earps-seafood-raleigh">Earps Seafood</a> - Local fish market, has fresh head-on shrimp.<br>
<li><a href="http://www.ncparks.gov/william-b-umstead-state-park">Umstead State Park</a> - 5 minute drive (for me), great trails.<br>
<li><a href="http://trianglemtb.com/crabtree.php">Lake Crabtree County Park</a> - And other areas to mountain bike.<br>
<li><a href="https://gardens.duke.edu/">Sarah P. Duke Gardens</a> - Nice place to unwind on the weekend.<br>
