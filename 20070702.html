<h1>20070702 - Market Research</h1>
<br>
As a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG) of a new genre, Atom is swimming in uncharted waters. 
Here are some notes on the MMOG market (mid 2006) from the <a href="/web/20100821214503/http://www.mmogchart.com/">MMOG Chart</a>.
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>12 million active MMOG subscriptions and growing fast.
<li>Roll Playing Games (RPG) are a majority of market, 93.5%. 
<li>FPS has 0.3% of market at 37,000 players.
<li>Other has 2.2% of market at 275,000 players.
<li>My guess is that the fantasy RPG side of online games is saturated, yet the growth for other types of games is possible.
<li>Key note from "GENERAL ANALYSIS" section in website, MMOG populations tend to follow hyperbolic or parabolic curves, 
with the most dramatic effect immediately after launch, so a good launch is very important!
</ol> 
<br>
Looking at a recient non-RPG game, Auto Assault, which targeted the niche market of automotive combat. 
Moral of this story, don't develop for a niche market using the high cost standard movie like game development model. 
Having 10,000 yearly subscribers at 1/12 the price would be fine for a single independent developer.
<br>
<br> 
<ol>
<li>Released Apr/2006, had 11,000 subscribers.
<li>They charge about $15/month (or $180/year).
<li>Which would be about $1.9 million a year in income.
<li>As of July/2007, they are shutting down.
</ol> 
<br>
<b>ESA Data</b>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.theesa.com/facts/gamer_data.php">ESA</a> has some great stats on the game market.<br>
<br>
<ol><li>69% of American heads of households play games.
<li>7.6 hours/week played on average for males.
<li>44% of most frequent game players play online.
</ol>
<br>
<b>MMORPG Data</b>
<br>
With the majority of online players playing the genre, MMORPG should represent the worst case in server load in terms of hours per week per player online. 
From <a href="http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/000758.php">The Daedalus Project</a>.<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Average online player plays 21.9 hours/week.
<li>Which would be over 90 hours a month.
<li>So over 1/8 of the time they are playing the game.
</ol>
