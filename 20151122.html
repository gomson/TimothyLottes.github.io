<b>Comments</b><br>
Picked up the MaxTech XT-4800 as never been used. Works awesome. The manual didn't have peak KHz and Hz, but did have max bandwidth. 
Wasn't able to hit peak bandwidth, but could get to 120 Hz. Internet searched peak says 100 Hz.
<br>
<br>
The KDS VS-195 is total garbage as it has a forced strong sharpening filter which cannot be disabled.
The Sony Vaio CPD E200 also has a forced less strong sharpening filter which cannot be disabled.
<br>
<br>
The eMachines eView was never used by the prior owner, and promptly died after one day of my use. It was a nice CRT, flat screen with a shadow mask. Would like to figure out a way to fix it.<br>
<br>
My HP 1024 does not have an internal degaussing coil and now has a color problem thanks to being stored too close to an old TV. Looking for an external degaussing coil, probably going to place near another monitor and degauss that one to get the HP 1024 fixed.<br>
<br>
The Dell Ultrascan 20TX was picked up on Craigslist, owner sold me a broken CRT without disclosing that, signal goes black for part of the middle of the screen.<br>
<br>
The Dell Trinitron UltraScan P991 is having problems, too used up.<br>
