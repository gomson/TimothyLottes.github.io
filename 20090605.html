<h1>20090605 - SIMD Binning And Caches</h1>
<br>

<pre>... since scatter time is a function of the number of cache lines, 
it might NOT be wise to bin into queues arranged in memory like this,

int Queue4Pixel0[16], int Queue4Pixel1[16], int Queue4Pixel2[16], ...

offset = (pixel << 4) + bin

Because only 1 queue would be on a cache line, so the scatter at best would be 16 cycles. 
Read back of the data later also might not be ideal in this format. 
Other option is this which has better cache locality at the expense of more complex offset logic,

int QueueBin0ForPixels0to16[16], int QueueBin1ForPixels0to16[16], ...

offset = (pixel & 15) + (((pixel & (~15)) + bin) << 4);

So for each grouping of 16 pixels, each queue bin is on the same cache line. 
Which in the completely coherent case would take a clock cycle to scatter to, 
 and would degrade in performance as a function of 
 how many different queue lengths there are in the groupings of 16 pixels.
