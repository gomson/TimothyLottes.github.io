<h1>20070712 - Fragment Raytracer</h1>
<br>



Not all ideas make it into something useful, this one is from my archives of things that never made it very far. 
I knew it wouldn't run fast enough, but wanted to see exactly what it would look like.
<br>
<br>
Combine 3D semi-transparent textures and ray tracing, all done in a fragment shader. 
Takes 3 textures, color+ray intersection acceleration distance, and material properties. 
Here is the result of rendering a 64x64x64 sized 3D texture that contained a bunch of spheres. 
Might be something to come back to when GPUs are 10x faster.
<br>
<br>
The "low polygon count" look is actually from the bilinear interpolation of the 64x64x64 textures, 
and the glow is caused by the normals being blended...
