<h1>20140809 - Strict Aliasing</h1>
<br>


<i>Strict aliasing from a different perspective.
Full disclosure,
for the most part at home I've moved on from C to my own language 
which is similar to an assembler 
running from a language similar to Color Forth.
So my bias is more towards performance and minimalism.</i><br>
<br>
When working in C, outside of work, I adopted labeling all pointers as either "restrict" or "volatile" (using the defines below to keep syntax tight). If needed reuse of a value read from a volatile pointer, it is read into a local variable. When working this way, strict aliasing makes no difference.<br>
<br>
<tt>
#define R_ restrict<br>
#define V_ volatile</tt><br>
