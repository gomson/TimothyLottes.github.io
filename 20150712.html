<h1>20150712 - Oh How Programming Has Changed</h1>
<br>

Programming in the 1990's: power on computer, open up text file in source editor, edit, run shell script to compile, test, repeat.<br>
<br>
Programming today: Put in windows password to get machine to wake up after automatically going to sleep, find that trackpad no longer works for some reason, pull usb mouse from another computer, click away popup of firefox asking for a security update right now, then find that Windows is also forcing an update and a reboot, find something else to do for a while, come back after machine reboots, bring up text file in source editor, edit, open developer command prompt for visual studio, find error message "ERROR: Cannot determine the location of the VS Common Tool folder", search on the internet for solution and find nothing that works, open up visual studio instead, get message that visual studio license no longer works, requires login, attempt to login with windows sign on, find that account has been temporarily disabled for some reason, go through process to re-enable account via email, click through message on email, re-login to windows sign on, get new message, account still disabled and for "security reasons" must re-enable via process through phone, choose SMS process, wait for a while, phone never gets SMS message, scramble to find another solution, try call method instead, finally get windows sign on re-enabled, finally get visual studio to work, build console project, click on option to not create a new directory, find it creates a new directory anyway, close visual studio, move around files, reopen, add source file to project, attempt to make a quick change to the code, notice that by default visual studio is reforming the code to something other than what is desired, look on internet to find out how to disable auto-format, disable auto-format, press F7 to compile, test, out of time for the day, repeat again tomorrow with a different selection of things which are randomly broken...<br>
