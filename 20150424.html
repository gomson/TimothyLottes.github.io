<h1>20150424 - Source-Less Programming : 4</h1>

<i>Still attempting to fully vet the design
before the bootstrap reboot...</i><br>
<br>
DAT words in the edit image need to maintain
their source address in the live image
This way on reload the live data can be copied over,
and persistent data gets saved to disk.
DAT annotations no longer have 30 bits of free space,
instead they have a live address.
When live address is zero. then DAT words
won't maintain live data.
This way read-only data can be self-repairing
(as long as the annotations don't get modified).
Going to use a different color for read-only DAT words.
New persistent data DAT words
will reference their edit-image hex value
before reload (then get updated to the live address).
<br>
<br>
REL words always get changed on reload (self repairing).
No need to keep the live address.
REL is only used for relative branching x86 opcodes.
Don't expect to have any run-time (non-edit-time)
self-modifying of relative branch addresses.
Given that branching to a relative branch opcode immedate
is not useful, the LABEL of a REL word is only useful
as a comment.
<br>
<br>
GET words also get changed on reload (self repairing).
GET is only designed for opcodes and labeled constants.
GET words will often be LABELed as a named branch/call target.
Been thinking about removing GET, and instead making a new
self-annotating word (display searches for a LABELed DAT
word with the same image value, then displays the
LABEL instead of HEX).
This opens up the implicit possibility of mis-annotations.
Would be rare for opcodes given they are large 32-bit values.
But for annotating things like data structure immediate offsets,
this will be a problem
(4 is the second word offset in any structure).
<br>
<br>
ABS words always get changed on reload (self repairing).
ABS words are targets for self-modifying code/data,
so they also need LABELs.
Reset on reload presents a problem in that
ABS cannot be used to setup persistent data
unless that persistent data is constant
or only built/changed in the editor.
But this limitation makes sense in the context
that ABS addresses in live data structures
can get invalidated by moving stuff around in memory.
The purpose of ABS is edit-time relinking.
