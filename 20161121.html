<h1>20161121 - Moving Beyond Rendering With Triangles</h1>
<br>
<center><i>This post describes practical non-triangle rendering working backwards from the back-buffer.</i></center>
<br>
<h2>Deferring Filtering to Image Reconstruction</h2>
Samples are shaded on fixed positions on objects instead of being interpolated to variable positions on a screen grid.
Filtering and interpolation are deferred until the end of the pipeline.
<strong>This means that shading rate is decoupled from resolution and frame rate,
filtering quality is decoupled from shading rate and coverage or Z test rate,
and shading is temporally stable.
</strong>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Reconstruction Happens in Post-Warped Space</b>
<br>
<strong>This is a non-optional critical component for image quality and performance!</strong>
This applies if a classic non-VR game is simulating a physical camera lens
or alternatively if a VR game is outputing to an HMD with a warped view.
The reconstruction filtering must be applied in post-warped space to look right.
<br>
<br>
<i>When a rectangular projection is bilinear fetched to implement a lens warp,
the output pixels on average are somewhere inbetween 4 texels,
and thus the output is that of a poor variable strength low-pass filter.
With MSAA, those 4 texels are typically the result of a second low-pass filter.
Part of the aim to have the app render 2x the pixels on average is to attempt to have enough aliasing
to counteract the low-pass filter(s).
This can never produce a high quality image.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Below is an image I recently re-found from years back using this reconstruction technique in colored monochrome
with a warped projection and all sub-pixel sized geometry with no temporal filtering (lower quality spatial reconstruction only).
It looks much better in video.

<b>Reconstruction Source Image</b>
<br>
<i>Presenting a good starting place to begin to construct a 64-bit version of what I've done in the past.
Yes this is another good time to point out that some PC platforms still don't expose 64-bit global atomics.
Working on fixing that ...</i>
<br> 
<br> 
The source for the reconstruction pass is in the post-warped space (ie exactly what gets scanned out)
and consists of a single 64-bit value per texel.
The resolution of this source image can be different than the output back-buffer size.
For instance it is possible to have 2x the area to have higher quality,
or 0.5x of the area to have up-sampling.
<br>
<br>
The 64-bit texel is a packed data structure.
Possible example of packing below.
Ordering requires that <tt>depth</tt> be at MSB bits,
but in theory other values could be moved around.
Bits per component and pre-packing transforms can be adjusted for various quality trade-offs.
This pass is expected to be ALU bound, so optimizing pack and un-pack could be important (possibly using LDS, or accept 8-bit for all non-depth components dithering really well before quantization, using SDWA to unpack, etc).
<br>
<br>
<pre>
OFFSET  BITS  MEANING
======  ====  =======
48      16    Logarithmic depth, reversed (65535=near, 0=far), at MSB
44      4     Weight (after depth so highest weight wins same depth collision)
32      12    Green
20      12    Red
8       12    Blue
4       4     Sub-pixel X offset
0       4     Sub-pixel Y offset
</pre>
<br>
In a pass before reconstruction, shaded samples are atomically scattered into this image using atomicMax64().
So the nearest depth will win a collision (then highest weight in my example, and so on).
<strong>The following is critical for image quality.</strong>
Collisions are expected, and transformed into film grain.
Right before scatter, each sample is given a spatial temporal stochastic blue-noise offset +/- one pixel in range.
The <tt>sub-pixel offset</tt> in the packed texel
provides the correct non-offseted original position to sub-pixel precision.
Sub-pixel X offset can be visualized as the following.
<br>
<br>
<pre>
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f

       +---------------+
       |               |
       .     pixel     .
</pre>
<br>
<tt>Weight</tt> is the sub-pixel area of the shaded sample, probably best to decode by converting to <tt>{0.0 to 1.0}</tt> and squaring. 
LOD fade-in and fade-out can be done stochastically and can be improved by reducing sub-pixel area to make more transparent.
<br>
<br>
For <tt>depth</tt> encoding, <a href="http://outerra.blogspot.com/2012/11/maximizing-depth-buffer-range-and.html">Maximizing Depth Buffer Range and Precision on the Outerra Blog</a>
is a great reference.
Use <tt>log(depth + 1.0)</tt> or perhaps the modified near field linearization talked about on Outerra.
This maximizes the depth precision in the scene.
<br>
<br>
The <tt>color</tt> should be decoded from a non-linear to linear space before filtering.
Perhaps something as easy as converting to <tt>{0.0 to 1.0}</tt> and squaring or cubing.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Reconstruction Filtering</b>
<br>
<i>Only have time to cover the basic spatial component of the reconstruction filter.
Incorporating a temporal component can be done for greatly increased quality.</i>
<br>
<br>
Spatial filter is easy to do, 
given an output pixel work with a fixed circular pattern of the nearest N texels in the 64-bit/texel image source.
Example of a N=12 pattern below
which would work well when source image size is not the same as output image size.
<br>
<br>
<pre>
  A B  
C D E F  
G H I J  
  K L  
</pre>
<br>
For each N texels, take the weighted average, sum the following for each sample, 
<tt>color * (weight * f(subPixelPrecisionDistanceFromSampleToResolvedPixelCenter))</tt>, divide by the sum of weights, <tt>(weight * f(...))</tt>.
The <tt>f()</tt> is the filter kernel which could be a Gaussian (which is <tt>exp2(-scale*dst*dst)</tt>), 
or for something sharper a circular filter with a soft fall-off (similar to DOF filter), or something better.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Grain</b>
<br>
After reconstruction filtering, add a linear blue-noise film grain for the final analog distraction-free output.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Anti-Aliased Composite of Transparency</b>
<br>
The best place to composite/apply transparency is before packing and scattering the 64-bit packed samples.
This way the sample can work with it's discrete depth value, interpolating from the likely lower resolution transparency layer.
Ultimately transparency then maintains the same high quality filtering as everything else.
<br>
<br>
Showing two stills below from a <a href="20150718.html">similar technique</a> in which a spatial temporal filter is used to filter 1-shaded sample/pixel lit fog,
which is then applied to opaque pixels which are traced in a stocastic pattern, 
then finally being reconstructed with a spatial temporal filter similar to the one described in this post
(using N nearest samples, taking a weighted average).

<b>Image Pyramid Reconstruction</b>
<br>
<i>What about hole filling and variable sized points?</i>
<br>
Will get to data expansion in the later section, this is another option/tool which can be used for creative solutions.
The idea is simple, take the projected size of the sample before 64-bit atomic scattering, 
and use it to choose a level in an image pyramid
(the pyramid is unpacked into a single texture layer).
Before reconstruction, run from smallest layer up, 
splitting the larger samples into interpolated smaller samples on each pass and merging with the next finer level.
When interpolating samples that are near to each other, remember to also do a <tt>weight</tt> based average 
and generate a new <tt>sub-pixel offset</tt>.
Ideally weight should be adjusted so that finer samples override similar depth coarser samples.
<br>
<br>
Another trick which I've <a href="20150709.html">employed in the past</a>
is to use the coarse level data to compute depth to get a more accurate estimate of reprojection to use to help fill in the holes.
<br>
<br>
<i>There are a collection of methods to manage reconstruction depending on engine details and desired quality/perf trade-offs,
and typical reconstruction costs are similar to temporal filtering with classic triangle rendering.</i>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Managing a Point Based Rendering Pipeline</h2>
<i>Lets continue with the elephant in the room, is it practical on current hardware?</i>
From what I've seen the answer is a definite yes,
and the gains in <a href="20161114.html">distraction free rendering</a> are substantial.
The engine I showed at my prior GTC talk, shot below, was driving 1080p at over 120 Hz.
That engine had per pixel costs over an order of magnitude from a simple point renderer, it was sphere traced.
It is effectively an engine optimized to solve the problem of skinning each pixel hundreds of times
(the sphere tracing distance estimator is a set of nested transforms).

<b>Rendering Traditional Game Assets</b>
<br>
Keep the standard sheet of mipmaped textures for surface properties.
Break the texture layers into SIMD friendly 8x8 tiles of texels.
Each tile contains some amount of per-tile meta-data (which is shared across the wave and can be fetched with SMEM) such as the following.
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Tile local coordinate space (offset and quaternion) used to compress object-space position
<li>Tile bone list (if skinned)
<li>Per texel bone weights (if skinned)
<li>Direction and solid angle (for tile back-face culling)
</ul>
<br>
Add an extra compressed texture sheet for object-space position in the tile local coordinate space.
Now geometry is fully represented in textures,
and only compute is needed to render.
<br>
<br>
<i>Rendering becomes a process of running a compute shader to fetch tile data,
transform, optionaly skin, and shade the collection of texels in the tile.
Pack the 64-bit sample values,
and output using atomicMax64() into the post-warped space for reconstruction later.</i>
<strong>Note sample data is loaded once, processed, and written only as a minimal 64-bit value.
Quite minimal in comparison with traditional fixed function which expands VS output to maximum size and routes around chip.
Also the tile has good final projected spatial locality, there is enough work to hide the atomic scatter cost, and atomic operations are fire-and-forget.</strong>
<br>
<br>
There are many other interesting variants, such as caching shading results in a tile cache.
Could keep updating the most important shading until some safe point before v-sync,
then switch to late-frame point atomic scatter for the 64-bit packed sample values.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Managing Data Expansion</b>
<br>
<i>The other elephant in the room, how to manage the need for hierarchical data expansion?
As in, this tile might project to a box of 8 texels, or fill a large chunk of the screen.
Or this tile might have high amounts of perspective. Etc ...</i>
<br>
<br>
My advice is to start with a temporally coherent listing of tiles,
similar to, or effectively exactly how one manages a virtual texture.
Except where typical virtual texturing would work in 128x128 granularity,
this is driven in 8x8 granularity.
Instanced objects would be given some local space in the virtual texture similar to how lightmaps have local space for instanced geometry.
This has the great side-effect of providing a place to cache texture space shading results.
<br>
<br>
It has been possible for a while now to fully manage a virtual texture on the GPU.
Part of the tile shading process will be to run HZB occlusion on the title,
check if it is visible, or percentage of visibility estimate which can be multiplied by projected size. 
This drives a LOD expand/prune priority for the tile in the virtual texture.
Adaptively manage a per-frame low watermark of visibility which is a cut-off where tiles self-prune 
to get recycled to attach to a new part of the virtual texture which needs to get expanded.
<br>
<br>
<i>Costs are thus bounded by the size of the physical tile cache.</i>
<br>
<br>
Virtual texture cache has limits to how much expansion can be done in a given frame,
typically one level/frame of expansion.
Fast motion can demand a lot more than that when projected texels are effectively kept close to pixel sized.
Some amount of expansion can be soked up with the <tt>"Image Pyramid Reconstruction"</tt> concept mentioned above.
The second tool is to allow the tile itself loop and walk it's own data at different scales based on the needs of visibility or projected texel density.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Tile Expansion - Variable Resolution Shading</b>
<br>
Tile starts at full size. Tile keeps track of a <tt>scale</tt> and <tt>{x,y}</tt> offset inside the the tile (these are low-cost dynamically uniform SGPRs).
Transforms (including skinning) to view-space, projects to post-warped space, and drives a waveMin and waveMax to gather projected bounds.
This projected bounds can be used to select which HZB layer to sample from for occlusion, and which level of the image pyramid to atomic scatter into.
If the output sample density isn't fine enough,
the tile can cut <tt>scale</tt> in half, and then quad sub-divide using <tt>{x,y}</tt> to track state as it walks across the sub-tile.
Any sub-tile which doesn't hit texel density targets can be further sub-divided at run-time in the same shader 
(by dropping <tt>scale</tt>, walking the sub-tile quad, and then moving to the prior <tt>scale</tt> backing out).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note this is compute. It is ok for tiles to have variable run-time, as long as they are bounded. Leverage the "Image Pyramid Reconstruction" for worst case expansion (bounded cost),
and limit the amount of hierarchical sub-division. Fast motion and scaling will often mask the ability for anyone to focus on details in a single frame anyway.</strong>
<br>
<br>
<i>There are many variations which could be quite interesting here.
For example, the shader can still do classic procedural texturing for enhanced detail,
except in this case the shader defined procedural detail can be fully 3D displacement mapped.</i>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Until Next Time</h2>
The intent of this post was to begin to paint a picture of the high-level of the major components which enable a non-triangle rendering path for traditional game content,
running backwards compatible hardware,
to get to pixel level detail with perfect anti-aliasing, 
with flexibibility to hit any resolution, shading rate, and frame rate trade-off.
There are many other aspects of the solution space to dive into in the future.
