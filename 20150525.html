<h1>20150525 - OS Project : 7 - PS/2 and Misc</h1>
<br>


Just started back up again after a long break.
Finished up the PS/2 driver.
Simplified keyboard interface to one 64-bit bit array in memory,
and a simple polling function.<br>
<br>
<pre>   __0 __1 __2 __3 __4 __5 __6 __7 __8 __9 __A __B __C __D __E __F
0| 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   A   B   C   D   E   F
1| G   H   I   J   K   L   M   N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V
2| W   X   Y   Z   `   -   =   [   ]   \   ;   '   ,   .   /   SPC
3| LF  RT  UP  DN  HOM END PUP PDN INS DEL BS  TAB RET SHF CTL ALT</pre>
<br>
Key down sets a bit.
Key release clears bits for {SHF, CTL, ALT} only.
It is up to the application to clear bits otherwise.
Ended up being a good design choice as keys like '\'
immediately generate release commands even when held down
on my keyboard.
Key bitmap organized to make editor usage (like key-to-hex conversions) simple.
Keys limited to what I expect to use, and
supporting everything on typical <a href="http://www.xgaming.com/support/questions/17/PC+%26+MAC+%28Mode1%29+Button+Layout">PC arcade controllers</a>.<br>

<b>Multitasking</b>
<br>
Humans and modern computers share a common thread: 
neither is any good at multitasking.
The context of multitasking in this post is not async IO,
but rather running multiple applications at the same time on the same CPU core.
Suspect that the needs of multitasking change quite a bit 
at the point where nearly everything on the machine is 
perceptually instantaneous: 
as it would be once the 30 years 
of 40% yearly compounding complexity dept is removed.
SSDs have throughput similar to last-level cache on early P4 era PCs.
Logical end point: CPU cores owned by the applications themselves,
no single-core multitasking, no preemption.
App using power control to drop CPU core to lowest power state required 
to sustain a hard real-time user interface.
