<b>Update Log</b>
<br>
2016/10/03 : 
Initial posting. Most of pipelining figured out.
Working through DSP input and operation details.
Have to think through data and return stack usage cases,
decide if data register file should just be removed and replaced with indexed fetched from data stack.
<br>
<br>
2016/10/02 :
Trying a different design path.
Concerned that the core which enables easy factored code, and thus well compressed code in limited memory,
is not having to optimize around a CPU pipeline from the perspective of a thread of execution.
So in this try, I'm working through paper implementation of a core which round-robins through 4 threads for a 4 stage pipeline
(talked about in <a href="20160705.html">this prior post</a>).
Maintaining variable bit-width address windows, and other things from prior post.

================
  FORTH HYBRID
================
Dual stack machine with register file
Core functional units,

  16-bit x 8-entry return stack (1 port) 
  32-bit x 8-entry data stack (1 port)
  32-bit x 8-entry register file (2 ports, port 0 for DSP input, port 1 for BRAM address)
  32-bit x 1024-entry BRAM (2 ports, port 0 for instruction fetch, port 1 for data)


===================
  EXECUTION MODEL
===================
4 threads/core of execution running with guaranteed round-robin scheduling
Instructions are VLIW style with a fixed logical ordered set of operations

  Order  Operation
  =====  =========
  1st    mux inputs for DSP ............ uses loads from prior instruction
  2nd    DSP execution .................
  3nd    load/store to REG and BRAM .... can store DSP result
  4th    branch ........................ can branch to DSP result


=====================
  PHYSICAL PIPELINE
=====================
Designing under the following constraints,

  Loads from RAMs are not used until next stage
  Each stage does only one LUT or ADD both of which can be vertically chained 
  DSP is fully pipelined

Outline,

         DSP  DSP  DSP  DSP  DSP  DAT  ADR  BLK  BLK
  Stage  A B  MUL  C    ADD  P    REG  REG  OUT  RAM  PC   INS

      2                 add            lut            add
      3                      lut  @!        lut  @!   lut  @
  -----  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---

  DSP A B .... DSP input a and b arguments
  DSP MUL .... DSP mul stage
  DSP C ...... DSP input c argument
  DSP ADD .... DSP add/op stage
  DAT REG .... Register file data load/store
  ADR REG .... Register file address register to BRAM address translation
  BLK OUT .... BRAM data construct write value
  BLK RAM .... BRAM data load/store
  PC ......... Update program counter
  INS ........ Fetch next instruction

=================================================
  ADDRESS REGISTER XOR INSTEAD OF ADD IMMEDIATE
=================================================
Planning on [address ^ immediate] addressing
  This removes an adder from the design

XOR is the same as [address + immediate] for an n-bit immediate
  When lower n-bits of address are zero
  Means data must be aligned to the nearest pow2 of maximum immediate offset

Using the following terms,
  ggggggoooo
    g =  group bits (address bits choose the group of data)
    o = offset bits (address bits are zero, immediate chooses element in group)

For bits in address which are not cleared (ie the group bits),
  Setting bits in the immediate results in accessing a neighbor group
  Regardless of the starting group in the address register
    It is possible to roll through all aligned groups
    But ordering is different based on starting group address
    Example of group bits for address crossed with immediate

           00 01 10 11   
         +-------------
      00 | 00 01 10 11
      01 | 01 00 11 10
      10 | 10 11 00 01
      11 | 11 10 01 00


===================================
  BRAM VARIABLE BIT-WIDTH WINDOWS
===================================
Trying to support transparent pack/unpack of variable bit-widths from BRAM
  Want zero impact to ISA, no special instructions
  Instead dividing address range into windows of different bit-widths
  Each address range addresses at a multiple of the bit-width
  Effectively the high bits of address choose the bit-width

Store path limited to {8,16,32}-bit
  Only using BRAM byte write mask to avoid any {read, modify, write}

Fixed signed vs unsigned configuration,

  size    choice
  ======  ======
  32-bit  signed (but doesn't matter)
  16-bit  going to go with signed (needed for vector or audio)
   8-bit  unsigned (keeps implementation simple)
   4-bit  unsigned for sure (sprites?)


==========================================
  WORKING THROUGH OPTIONS DSP OPERATIONS
==========================================
Opcode forms,

  p = c op ((a << 16) + unsigned(b))
  p = c + (a * b)  
  p = c - (a * b)

Where op can be the following,

  and .....
  nand ....
  nor .....
  not .....
  or ......
  xnor ....
  xor .....

Where the following can also be applied,

  extra set c bit -1 to 1 (for rounding)
  (a * b) can be forced to zero (nop)
  ((a << 16) + unsigned(b)) can be forced to zero (nop) 
  ((a << 16) + unsigned(b)) can be forced to all ones 


===============================================
  WORKING THROUGH OPTIONS FOR A,B,C DSP INPUT
===============================================
DSP inputs (as they appear in the core),
  
  24-bit a
  16-bit b
  40-bit c

Possible inputs,
  
  10-bit immediate 
  16-bit top of return stack
  32-bit top of data stack
  32-bit register file load (from prior instruction)
  32-bit BRAM load (from prior instruction)
  40-bit DSP p output
  

====================
  FAST ABS MIN MAX
====================
Simple design exercise to think through DSP issues

These need to work on the 40-bit accumulator without precision loss
  So using multiply stage is out

Min and max, where a is the accumulator, and b is the limit,

  min(a, b) = ((a - b) & ((a - b) < 0 ? ~0 : 0)) + b
  max(a, b) = ((a - b) & ((a - b) < 0 ? 0 : ~0)) + b

Want to be able do the following,

  acc -= b; 
  acc = acc < 0 ? acc : 0; // want to fold this into prior operation
  acc += b;
  
Have to either LUT or register p in stage 3,
  Could LUT p to zero if signed or unsigned based on control bit
  This works out to 2-bits/LUT (pair of 5:1 functions with same input)
  So 20 LUTs total (same as just registering)
    Plus likely need to decode control and enable from opcode in prior pass

  inputs
  ------
  2 p bits
  1 p sign bit (might want the overflow sign bit?)
  1 enable bit
  1 signed or unsigned control bit

This enables min and max to work in 2 instructions without branching

Absolute value,

  abs(a) = max(a, -a)

Does this make the case for,

  expanding data stack to 40-bit (to match accumulator)?
  reducing accumulator to 36-bit, or even 32-bit?

Operation,

  push copy of acc; // want to fold into start of next op
  acc += acc; acc = acc < 0 ? 0 : acc; 
  acc -= pop;

Using top of data stack for DSP input means it must be pre-registered
  That register could be 40-bit until it gets actually stored on stack
  Want a bit which marks if should consume data stack

Ideally push to happen before the first add (included in that opcode)
  Stage 0 : must save top to stack RAM
  Stage 1 : set top to p
    Todo, think through when c is computed again

Data stack top is going to be expensive
  40-bit : minimum 80 LUTs
  32-bit : minimum 64 LUTs

Time to rethink ...
