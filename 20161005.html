<a href="https://www.parallella.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/e5_1024core_soc.pdf">Epiphany-V: A 1024 processor 64-bit RISC System-On-Chip PDF</a><br>
Looks like it does 2 32-bit d = a * b + c floating point operations, or 4096 flops/clock.<br> 
If they hit 1 GHz they would be around 4 Tflop/s with 64 MB of on-chip memory.<br>
In 16nmFF+ with 117 mm^2 area, with 4.56 B transistors.<br>
Looks quite disruptive.<br>
NV's 1080 in 16nmFF+ is nearly 3x area for maybe only around 2x the flops, with a lot less on-chip memory.<br>
