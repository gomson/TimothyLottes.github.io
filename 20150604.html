<h1>20150604 - Panasonic CT-34WX59 = Piece of Junk</h1>
<br>

<i>Waiting for "Updating dependencies...", time to reflect on a fail while CRT hunting...</i><br>
Majority mass market consumer "HDTV ready" CRTs closing out the CRT TV era scanned out 1080i
using an aperture grille (and some with a shadow mask) which could never resolve 1920x.
Because of that they were effectively 960x540p displays limited to a smaller resolution by overscan.
This is not a problem, this is exactly what I wanted.
The CT-34WX59 is a 34" 16:9 CRT which can do 896x512 displayable at 60Hz via an HDMI cable and a custom modeline.
I grabbed it for $10 on Craigslist.
That was a 180 lbs mistake.
I knew the display had a sharpen control,
I didn't know Panasonic's idea of sharpen=0 adds ringing to everything: they don't support fully turn sharpening off.
Some Panasonic displays don't have a Scan Velocity Modulation (SVM) disable,
so just in case I opened up the TV and un-did the <a href="http://www.keohi.com/keohihdtv/brandspecific/panasonic/disabling_svm.html">physical connector which I believed was for the SVM feature</a>: didn't fix it.
Attempted to find an override in the service menu, nothing there.
Did some more testing: all 1920x1080i, 1920x540p, or 960x540p based modelines all get the same over-sharpening effect.
Effectively this display was garbage even when new,
avoid Panasonic when CRT hunting...
