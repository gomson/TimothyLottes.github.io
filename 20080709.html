<b>Anti-Aliasing</b>
<br>

Got anti-aliasing working in engine without hardware AA, using temporal jitter, sub-pixel positioning, and frame feedback. The 720P shots below (running at over 60fps on my NVidia 8600 GTS) were generated from only 256 K/pixels per frame. So I'm effectively only computing 25% of the screen pixels a frame. Which is great, builtin "keeping it low res".
