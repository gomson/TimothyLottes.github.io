<h1>20081014 - Octahedron Mapping</h1>
<br>

Often when solving a problem it is necessary to map or project a 3D space into a 2D space for efficient computation. Commonly used mappings are cubemaps, sphere maps, and dual paraboloid maps. Each have different trade offs. The octahedron map is another option. Take the 8 sided octahedron and flatten it into a texture, as in the really poor ASCII art below.

ABCD -> -z half of octahedron
EFGH -> +z half of octahedron

For 1/8 the coordinates in the unit sphere where x,y,z all > 0,

s = x / (x+y+z)
t = y / (x+y+z)

And to reverse,

x = s / (s^2 + t^2 + (1-s-t)^2)^(1/2)
y = t / (s^2 + t^2 + (1-s-t)^2)^(1/2)
z = (1-s-t) / (s^2 + t^2 + (1-s-t)^2)^(1/2)
