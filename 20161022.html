<h1>20161022 - Variation on Branching Design - Return Only</h1>
<br>

<i>Thoughts related to <a href="20161016.html">Instruction Fetch Optimization</a>, a post which talked about only auto-incrementing the lower 8-bits of the program counter, having even-only branch addresses to remove an ADDer delay...</i><br>
<br>
<b>Return Only ISA</b>
<br>
The point here is to be able to know the next program counter, even with a branch, a clock cycle ahead to remove instruction fetch latency from a larger RAM.
This works with absolute branching (no relative branching).
The minimal ISA has the following,
<br>
<br>
(1.) Push immediate absolute address on return stack.<br>
(2.) Push computed absolute address from register on return stack.<br>
(3.) 1-bit flag in ISA (on all instructions) to return after 1 cycle delay.
<br>
<br>
So the return bit causes the top of the return stack to be registered for fetch.
Assume an optimization here where a push immediate with a return gets transformed into just setting that registered value.
Bunch of usage cases,
<br>
<br>
<pre>// RETURN
opcode, ret; // ... register for future return
opcode; // ........ branch delay slot
// ................ actual return

// COMPUTED JUMP
push reg, ret; // ... push jump address from register and register for future return
opcode; // .......... branch delay slot
// .................. actual jump

// JUMP
push imm, ret; // ... push jump address and register for future return
opcode; // .......... branch delay slot
// .................. actual jump

// CAN PUSH ADDRESS EARLIER
push imm; // ...... push jump address to later branch to
opcode; // ........ some code
opcode; // ........ some code
opcode, ret; // ... register for future return
opcode; // ........ branch delay slot
// ................ actual jump

// SERIES OF JUMPS
push imm; // ........ push addresses for series of branches in reverse order
push imm; // ........ push addresses for series of branches in reverse order
push imm, ret; // ... push first jump address and register for future return
opcode; // .......... branch delay slot
// .................. start first jump, later rets continue to other jumps

// SERIES OF JUMPS VERSION 2
push imm; // ........ push 4th jump address
push imm; // ........ push 3rd jump address
push imm, ret; // ... push 1st jump address and register for future return
push imm; // ........ push 2nd jump in branch delay slot
// .................. start first jump, later rets continue to other jumps

// CALL
push imm, ret; // ... push call address and register for future return
push imm; // ........ push return address in delay slot
// .................. actual call here

// SERIES OF CALLS
push imm; // ........ push 3nd call address
push imm; // ........ push 2nd call address
push imm, ret; // ... push 1st call address and flag for future return
push imm; // ........ push final call return address in delay slot
// .................. start first call, later rets continue without returning back in between</pre>

<br>
No need for call/jump right after logical return (which would have a delay slot), because that can always be factored to a "series" case.
<br>
<br>
Another option would be a co-return bit in addition to the return bit.
The co-return would swap the top of the return stack with the program counter + 1.
This would remove the need to push the final return address for a single call,
but won't help with a series of calls (cannot use the co-return, as need reverse order).
