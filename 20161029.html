=====================
  PROGRAM PER CLOCK
=====================
The high level concept is to chain all ALUs on a massively multi-core machine,
  such that each ALU runs one instruction of a program,
  and each clock another instance of the program starts at head of chain.
This is PPMD, or Pipelined Program Multiple Data.
Programs act more like filters, are conditional branch free,
  and effectively fully unrolled.
The Multiple Data need not be constrained to a SIMD-width.
Instruction/immediate fetch is fully amortized,
  only costs when the program is changed, regardless of how much data flows through.
Instructions/immediates are registered at the ALU and reused.
Program intermediate state flows down the pipeline (forwarded).
Chained ALUs perfect for accumulator style programming (minimize local state).
Each ALU can maintain state temporally as well,
  so reductions are serially work optimal (vs SIMD which has a log2 cost).
The ALU is a FPGA DSP chained using dedicated hardware columns.
Instructions effectively set the MUXes at DSP inputs or DSP controls or forwarding MUXes.

=======================
  SCATTER/PUSH DESIGN
=======================
Stores for local state are fully factored out from the program (forwarded instead).
Only stores left act more like "commits" for data, and these stores are latency tolerant. 
Atomics are factored into the "free reductions" (not needed).
Some percentage of ALUs in the chain will support {address,value} outputs.
On-chip routing network will handle getting writes to the correct bank of memory.

====================
  WHAT ABOUT READS
====================
This is the challenging part which likely needs lots more thought,
  as design does not support hiding latency from reads.
First some numbers thinking through GPU design,
  4 Toperation/s : 0.5 Tbyte/s = 8:1 op/byte = 32:1 op/dword
If the machine had roughly 1024 cores chained,
  each mini-program on average would consume around 32 dwords of data.
32 dwords is two 64-byte cachelines.
Initial idea is to give some ALUs in the chain 
  direct read access to one bank of a massively banked global memory. 
This introduces the constraint that programs 
  must generally access data in bank order, 
  or forward read data to later in the program's execution.
Addresses would be generated or forwarded from earlier parts of execution.

=========
  ALIEN
=========
So the programming model for this kind of machine is quite alien.
But I like where the hardware design is going
  as it minimizes the registering of program state during execution,
  simplifies a lot of the challenges of parallel execution,
  and makes it easy to maximize ALU throughput.
Have a lot of other things to think through,
  like how data compression fits in or not,
  how the chain can be split for non-chain sized programs or not,
  how to do program changes, etc.</pre>
