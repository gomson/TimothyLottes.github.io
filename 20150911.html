<h1>20150911 - Self-Correcting CPU Pipelines</h1>
<br>

<i>Elaborating an idea which came up in a prior conversation...</i><br>
<br>
The aim is to make CPU programming as fun and easy as iterative run-time edit reload based GPU shader programming.

Re-purpose the CPU page tables for intra-app memory protection between in-app tasks.
Effectively providing hardware protection for functional programming.

When in-app tasks switch, adjust page table protection, then use INVLPG (on 486 and up) to flush TLB entries for changed pages.
The page tables change to disallow writes to now read-only data from the prior completed job,
and to allow writes to write-able data for the current job.
Use x86's support for various page sizes and pre-staged page tables for fixed jobs to make this efficient.

Setup a background watchdog to act as a TDR check, to reset to a stable state if any task runs too long (infinite loop, etc).

The "kernels" or CPU jobs which transform data can also be designed to be somewhat self correcting,
using min or max to limit indexes, etc...
