<h1>20160704 - Relative Addressing With XOR - Removing an Adder</h1>
<br>

Could be an interesting compromise: use XOR instead of ADD for relative addressing to remove an adder. Specifically,
<br>
<br>
<tt>Address = AddressRegister XOR Immediate</tt>
<br>
<br>
Forces the programmer to keep address register on some power of two alignment.
With caches and/or parallel access to banked memory, this would be a bad.
But likely fine for a core with a private memory, and code written in assembly.
