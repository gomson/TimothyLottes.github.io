<h1>20090506 - Electromagnetic Spectrum and Rendering</h1>
<br>

I find it interesting that as humans working on rendering technology, we are obsessed with the visible spectrum when there is so much more,<br /><br /><b>Gamma Rays and X-Rays</b><br /><br />Wavelength of Atomic Nuclei to Atoms. Below is a VACIS gamma-ray image of stowaways in a truck. Also check out <a href="http://www.nickveasey.com/">Nick Veasey's X-ray Photography</a>. Would be interesting to do real-time graphics like this, but dynamically adjusting per pixel exposure in order to capture views of large scenes...<br /><br /><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/VACIS_Gamma-ray_Image_with_stowaways.GIF" width=640 height=180><br /><br /><b>Mid-Infrared</b><br /><br />Wavelength slightly smaller than a really thin human hair. Real-time rendering done before in that awesome AC-130 level of Call of Duty 4 (screen shot below). The level had this analog real visual feel you don't get from our misguided attempts to simulate the visible spectrum in real-time.<br /><br /><img src="http://callofduty.neoseeker.com/w/i/callofduty/e/e9/DeathFromAbove.jpg"><br /><br />I'd like to see a mix of mid-infrared and x-ray rendered in real-time...
