<h1>20161105 - Owlboy via CRT</h1>
<br>
<center><i>Getting Owlboy working on a 29" Makvision VGA Arcade CRT from a VGA Port of an APU based laptop.</i></center>
<br>
Owlboy appears to be rendering around 640 pixels across, and then when windowed, doubling pixels to get to 1280. 
It is possible to get Owlboy full-screen on a 640×480×60Hz VGA output, for pixel perfect CRT display (no doubling).
<br>
<br>
Current AMD 16.9.2 Driver has a bug which won’t allow the user to make a custom resolution. 
Was unable to find old drivers on the AMD website until I duckduckgo’ed for old driver and found a link which can be used to grab old drivers,

<a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/apu/previous?os=Windows%208.1%20-%2064">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/apu/previous?os=Windows 8.1 - 64</a>
<br>
<br>
If not using an APU and not on Windows 8.1, then use the regular driver search to figure out what path (/apu/ part) and query (?os= part) to adjust the URL to. 
Crimson Edition 16.7.3 WHQL from 7/28/2016 has working custom resolutions.
<br>
<br>
Once the driver is installed, connect the VGA CRT and make it the primary monitor. 
I found I was unable to get full-screen to work at the correct resolution otherwise. 
Next bring up <tt>Radeon Settings</tt>, click on the <tt>Preferences</tt> button at the bottom, 
and then click on the <tt>Radeon Additional Settings</tt>. This brings up a new window. 
Click on the <tt>Custom Resolutions</tt> button for the attached VGA display. 
Then click on the <tt>New</tt> button and setup for 640×480×60Hz with Progressive and CVT as the timing standard. 
Then click <tt>Verify</tt> to generate the mode. Accept the mode. 
With the mode set, start Owlboy and go into full-screen mode (F11 if I remember right),
and remember to turn letter-box on.

<br>
The game played this way is stunning.
