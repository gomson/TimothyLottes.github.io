<h1>20161017 - Notes from Attempting to Understand FPGA Timing Limits</h1>
<br>

<i>I'm using the table I built below as a quick reference to think though timing while working on design.
Reference from last time,
<a href="http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds181_Artix_7_Data_Sheet.pdf">Artix-7 FPGAs Data Sheet: DC and AC Switching Characteristics</a>.
Working from the Speed Grade -3 (fastest) numbers in ns below.</i>

        BRAM address register       BRAM registered read stable

My mental model is that the 'delay' eats against the 'setup' for the next stage
Each stage ends in a register (D flip-flop)
The cumulative post register, combinatorial, and net 'delay' from any logic on the wire
  must not violate the 'setup' time for the stage's register
The 'hold' effects the limits of the phase of the stage (offset from positive clock edge)

Timing limits from my (possibly flawed) understanding of the doc,

  term  meaning

  BRAM  block ram
  CRAM  CLB distributed ram

  number   meaning
  =======  =======
  0.07 ns  CLB 6:1 LUT setup time
  0.59 ns  CLB complex setup time (larger than 6:1, carry)
  0.12 ns  CLB 6:1 LUT hold time
  0.08 ns  CLB complex hold time
  -------  -------
  0.47 ns  CLB 5:1x2 LUT registered delay (2 reg/LUT)
  0.40 ns  CLB registered delay otherwise (1 reg/LUT)
  -------  -------
  0.10 ns  CLB 6:1 LUT combinatorial delay (no register)
  0.27 ns  CLB 5:1x2 LUT combinatorial delay
  0.68 ns  CLB maximum combinatorial delay for complex (larger than 6:1, carry)
  -------  -------
  0.26 ns  DSP a setup time
  0.33 ns  DSP b setup time
  0.17 ns  DSP c setup time
  0.12 ns  DSP a hold time
  0.15 ns  DSP b hold time
  0.17 ns  DSP c hold time
  0.33 ns  DSP p registered output delay  
  -------  -------
  0.45 ns  BRAM address setup time
  0.31 ns  BRAM address hold time
  0.64 ns  BRAM registered read delay before stable time
  -------  -------
  0.27 ns  CRAM address setup time
  0.69 ns  CRAM address setup time with post-load carry or mux usage
  0.55 ns  CRAM address hold time
  0.18 ns  CRAM address hold time with post-load carry or mux usage
  0.10 ns  CRAM read registered output delay (same as 6:1 LUT combinatorial delay)
  0.98 ns  CRAM write registered output delay (CRAM 64-entry or smaller, etc)
  2.10 ns  CRAM minimum clock period for writes (limits to 476 MHz?)
