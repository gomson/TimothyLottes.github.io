<b>Update Log</b>
<br>
2016/10/04 : 
Trying dropping data stack (won't fit, gets expensive with adders if doing indexed access). 
Have something figured out for DSP inputs. 
Rethinking ISA, have place holder for now to see that things fit in worst case.
Thinking estimated 81% LUT usage so far will be too much, perhaps drop accumulator down from 40-bits to 36-bits or 32-bits?
The problem I see with this design is that due to load/store being at the end of the pipeline,
after a store, the next instruction will be starved of inputs.
Next try (4) will likely focus on {load/store, mux input, mul, add} ordered pipeline,
which will attempt to make {load,dsp}, {store,return}, {dsp,call/jmp}, VLIW instruction usage work well,
but will likely require a forth like address register (to avoid 2 dependent loads before feeding the dsp).

<b>Notes</b><pre>
==================
  CORE RESOURCES
==================
Core functional units,

  16-bit x 8-entry return stack (1 port) 
  32-bit x 8-entry register file (2 ports, port 0 for DSP input, port 1 for BRAM address)
  32-bit x 1024-entry BRAM (2 ports, port 0 for instruction fetch, port 1 for data)


===================
  EXECUTION MODEL
===================
4 threads/core of execution running with guaranteed round-robin scheduling
Instructions are VLIW style with a fixed logical ordered set of operations

  Order  Operation
  =====  =========
  1st    mux inputs for DSP ............ uses loads from prior instruction
  2nd    DSP execution .................
  3nd    load/store to REG and BRAM .... can store DSP result
  4th    branch ........................ can branch to DSP result


=====================
  PHYSICAL PIPELINE
=====================
Designing under the following constraints,

  Loads from RAMs are not used until next stage
  Each stage does only one LUT or ADD both of which can be vertically chained 
  DSP is fully pipelined

The reason for the 2-bit padding,
  Can reuse the join(a,b) cases as a>>16 for the multiply input


=======================
  DSP INPUT CHALLENGE
=======================
Need to support both
  BRAM unpack in the LUT
  DSP a and b inputs separate
  DSP a and b inputs joined {MSB a, b LSB}
    Which forces needing unpack options with >>16 (not going to fit)

Solving this by
  Only supporting unpack in c and b
  The {MSB a, b LSB} input is only going to support p (accumulator feedback)
    The c input is reused for the non-accumulator input
    This works out because only subtract in {MSB a, b LSB} cases is non-associative
  The mul cases will still use c as an accumulator
  Not supporting unpacking in the a input

  IDEA LIST
=================================================
Want to be able to use address register fetch for DSP source

Would be nice to get to 16-bit immediate to be able to do self modify immediates




=================================================
  ADDRESS REGISTER XOR INSTEAD OF ADD IMMEDIATE
=================================================
Planning on [address ^ immediate] addressing
  This removes an adder from the design

XOR is the same as [address + immediate] for an n-bit immediate
  When lower n-bits of address are zero
  Means data must be aligned to the nearest pow2 of maximum immediate offset

Using the following terms,
  ggggggoooo
    g =  group bits (address bits choose the group of data)
    o = offset bits (address bits are zero, immediate chooses element in group)

For bits in address which are not cleared (ie the group bits),
  Setting bits in the immediate results in accessing a neighbor group
  Regardless of the starting group in the address register
    It is possible to roll through all aligned groups
    But ordering is different based on starting group address
    Example of group bits for address crossed with immediate

  BRAM VARIABLE BIT-WIDTH WINDOWS
===================================
Trying to support transparent pack/unpack of variable bit-widths from BRAM
  Want zero impact to ISA, no special instructions
  Instead dividing address range into windows of different bit-widths
  Each address range addresses at a multiple of the bit-width
  Effectively the high bits of address choose the bit-width

Store path limited to {8,16,32}-bit
  Only using BRAM byte write mask to avoid any {read, modify, write}

Fixed signed vs unsigned configuration,

  size    choice
  ======  ======
  32-bit  signed (but doesn't matter)
  16-bit  going to go with signed (needed for vector or audio)
   8-bit  unsigned (keeps implementation simple)
   4-bit  unsigned for sure (sprites?)


==========================================
  WORKING THROUGH OPTIONS DSP OPERATIONS
==========================================
Opcode forms,

  p = c op ((a << 16) + unsigned(b))
  p = c + (a * b)  
  p = c - (a * b)

Where op can be the following,

  and .....
  nand ....
  nor .....
  not .....
  or ......
  xnor ....
  xor .....

Where the following can also be applied,

  extra set c bit -1 to 1 (for rounding)
  (a * b) can be forced to zero (nop)
  ((a << 16) + unsigned(b)) can be forced to zero (nop) 
  ((a << 16) + unsigned(b)) can be forced to all ones

  10-bit immediate 
  16-bit top of return stack
  32-bit register file load (from prior instruction)
  32-bit BRAM load (from prior instruction)
  40-bit DSP p output


====================
  FAST ABS MIN MAX
====================
These need to work on the N-bit accumulator without precision loss
  So using multiply stage is out

Min and max, where a is the accumulator, and b is the limit,

  min(a, b) = ((a - b) & ((a - b) < 0 ? ~0 : 0)) + b
  max(a, b) = ((a - b) & ((a - b) < 0 ? 0 : ~0)) + b

Want to be able do the following,

  acc -= b; 
  acc = acc < 0 ? acc : 0; // want to fold this into prior operation
  acc += b;
  
Have to either LUT or register p in stage 3,
  Could LUT p to zero if signed or unsigned based on control bit
  This works out to 2-bits/LUT (pair of 5:1 functions with same input)
  So 20 LUTs total (same as just registering)
    Plus likely need to decode control and enable from opcode in prior pass

  inputs
  ------
  2 p bits
  1 p sign bit (might want the overflow sign bit?)
  1 enable bit
  1 signed or unsigned control bit

This enables min and max to work in 2 instructions without branching

Absolute value this way is not friendly for accumulator,

  abs(a) = max(a, -a)

Instead leverage the "free" branching (single cycle abs),

  ...; if(acc>=0) goto then; // add branch to end of prior op
  acc = -acc;                // works since acc is now in a:b for 1ops and 2ops
  then:
