<h1>20090318 - Reattachable Code</h1>

<b>Reattachable Code</b>
<br>
<strong>For the new iPhone version of Atom I decided to go with reattachable code for development. 
The entire codebase can be recompiled at runtime at reattached to the running executeable. 
This enables all sorts of quick development such as testing and profiling changes on a live running engine.</strong>
<br><br>
For development the code is compiled as a library, a small loader program makes a copy of the library, and loads the library copy to run the program. 
The program allocates all data at startup, and uses one single pointer to reference any data. 
I use nothing global except read only data. 
While the program is running the original library can be recompiled. 
Then in one key press, the program returns to the loader and returns that single data pointer. 
The loader makes a copy of the new library, loads the copy, and passes in the data pointer to the new code. 
Then the engine continues where it left off.</p> <p>For release the single pointer references a static global, so related compiler optimizations are enabled.

<b>GPGPU Course Notes</b>
<br>
Jawed a <a href="http://forum.beyond3d.com/">Beyond3D</a> regular poster, posted a link to some rather good GPGPU 
<a href="http://coachk.cs.ucf.edu/courses/CDA6938/notes.htm">course notes from ECE 498AL</a> at UIUC. 
Too bad GPGPU didn't exist when I was there...

<b>QuickMath</b>
<br>
For those who don't have a copy of <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/index.html">Mathematica</a> 
the <a href="http://www.quickmath.com/">www.quickmath.com</a> site can once and a while be a great time saver.

<b>GDC09</b>
<br>
Second year at HH and like last year, I won't be with the other HHers going to GDC. 
Also probably won't get to all the presentations until the week after GDC, but greatly looking forward to it all...

<b>More Atom iPhone Updates</b>

Working on the hidden surface removal algorithm, attempting to solve the unsolvable problem. 
Only get 8K-16K triangles, want lots of graphics, oh and cannot use blending. 
No problem. Doing extreme LOD, and working on the "Grove of Trees" problem. 
Best way to solve the problem of too many things to draw, is not to draw too many things, even if they are all visible.
 Problem ends up being more of an art than a science, how to insure all LOD transitions are smooth and clean.
<br>
<br>
Fade in is now working quite well. LOD fade in of higher detail looks like the object is "growing". 
So fade in nodes start out with zero size, and increase to full size. 
Most of the time the new nodes start hidden inside the parent and the effect looks great. 
This is about the best which can be done without blending.
<br>
<br>
Fade out is a complex problem without blending. I have in for testing frame-dithered fade out (faking transparency). 
Just wanted to see what it would look like, didn't seem as bad as I thought it would be. 
Actually looks good in cases of a good amount of framebuffer feedback. 
Current implementation shrinks down size of fade out nodes, and uses a little frame-dithered transparency. 
Going to try fade out by shrinking node into most dominate child later this evening. Not sure what I am going to go with here.
<br>
<br>
I'm thinking about visuals now that I have a much better idea of what is possible on the platform.
 I thinking of trying my layered brush idea Redid my performance estimates for the GPU side. 
Seems like everything should work out based on previous testing on the actual device. 
Even thinking I could combine my feedback with a 2nd texture. Not sure if this is a good idea however.
 I hear two conflicting things about the iPhone: that it has a unified CPU/GPU memory and that it has a dedicated 16MB of VRAM. 
Wouldn't want to starve the CPU bandwidth if it is a unified memory device. CPU side is a big unknown performance wise. 
I'm still hoping that I don't have to do lots of custom VFP code.

<strong>Hardest part of development is keeping out all the distracting ideas. Last week I took a weekend away just to work on the project, 
for some reason I don't get work done when my wife is around.</strong> 
I also need to stop reminding myself that a PS3 test station is only $1200, 
and that I could just massively scale up (>100x more triangles) this iPhone Atom engine for the PS3 
(turns out my other blending Atom engine wouldn't scale to the PS3 without fine grain early stencil, a DX10 level hardware feature). 
At least I have a backup plan if all doesn't go as planned. 
Building for strangled low Watt hardware has been a great experience, 
for once I'm not building stuff for not yet mainstream hardware. 
Might even break what seems to be a theme in my life, that I only get stuff done at work. 
In fact I might be the last person at work here now this Thursday waiting on a compile to do a few final tests before a check-in of a bug fix which needed to be in by tomorrow.

<b>OpenGL3 Idea I'm Saving for Later</b>
<br>
Been wanting to build a geometry streamer in combination with a version of my Atom HSR/LOD code.
 The idea would be to stream in and out geometry just like textures. 
Vertex buffer would be chunked up into fixed size pages, geometry paged in and out at run-time. 
Index buffer would also be adjusted dynamically such that I could have one draw per material, 
grouping all geometry and all objects for that draw into this dynamic index buffer. 
Pre-Z pass would have similar large sets of draw calls with multiple objects grouped into big calls. 
Grouping would be linked to hierarchical level of detail and visibility system. 
Everything would be wrapped into a nice virtual texture system, and use vertex texture fetch to deal with skinning many objects in one call. 
Would have been great for the DX10 generation which never really took off.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Anyway with OpenGL3, building a dynamic vertex buffer this way is a possibility. 
One can glMapBufferRange() with GL_MAP_UNSYNCHRONIZED_BIT to enable writes to a vertex buffer when it is being used by the driver.
 The key is knowing when the driver has finished with previous draw calls. 
My idea was to place a dummy occlusion query test at the end of the frame so that I could asynchronously query for completion to know when that frame was completed
 and thus when it is safe to do an unsynchronized map buffer range for a dynamic update.</strong>
